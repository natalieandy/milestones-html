  <h1>Development Environment</h1>
   <h2>Command Line</h2>
   <!--Learned how to comment here [url-comment-tag], how to make a bulleted list here [url-ul-tag], and how to cite these sources this way by referring to the README.md file-->
   <p><i>When using the command line, remember that every character counts! Yes, even the spaces!</i></p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>How to open the terminal outside of VS Code (using a Mac)</strong></li>
      <!--Learned how to make ordered lists here [url-ordered-lists]-->
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Hold the command key and spacebar to open "Spotlight Search"</li>
            <li>Begin typing "terminal" into the spotlight search––it should appear as you start typing.</li>
            <li>Select the terminal application, this should open after pressing the enter key or by clicking on the application itself.</li>
          </ol>
      <li><strong>How to use "cd" to navigate between directories</strong></li>
          <p><i>Before starting, it's helpful to know that "cd" stands for "computer directory," so when we use this command, we are essentially directing the computer to the directory we intend to make changes to or otherwise need information on. "Directories" refer to what we (assumingly non-technical people) call "folders."</i></p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Begin by typing the command "cd" by itself. This is the initial starting point for the computer to begin looking for subsequent directories. Imagine one big diagram that displays hirearchies, where there is one starting point (the "cd" command, or main computer directory) that breaks into different parts to form one large procedure of steps, or in this analogy, levels.</li>
            <li>You'll most likely want to navigate files within the Desktop (the area you see, decorated with files and folders and lives behind the browsers or applications you open), so your next command is "cd Desktop" to narrow in on the directories within the Desktop.</li>
            <li>To work with a particular directory on the Desktop, type "cd Desktop insertyourfilenamehere"</li>
            <li>To exit the directory you're currently working in (to back-up, if you will), you have to start over by beginning with the initial "cd" command.</li>
            <li>Happy navigating!</li>
          </ol>
     <li><strong>How to use "ls" to list the contents of a directory</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>After navigating to a particular directory (be it the initial directory ("cd"), Desktop––whichever directory you chose), type "ls" to reveal the directory's contents.</li>
          </ol>
    <li><strong>How to use "mkdir" to create an empty directory</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Begin by choosing the directory in which you'd like to create your new directory in, and orient the computer there (using the "cd" commands explained earlier).</li>
            <li>Type the command "mkdir insertnameofyournewdirectoryhere"</li>
            <li>You should now be able to view your new directory within the larger directory you made it in. For example, if all you wanted to do was create a new directory on the Desktop, that the computer was oriented in the "cd Desktop" location.</li>
          </ol>
    <li><strong>How to use "touch" to create an empty file</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Similar to how we can create new directories within directories, we can create new files too! Simply type the command "touch insertnameofyournewfilehere" and your new file will appear under the directory you created it in.</li>
          </ol>
    <li><strong>How to use "code" to open VS Code</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Navigate to the appropriate directory (the one that has files you'd like to code) using the commands discussed above.</li>
            <li>Once in the appropriate directory, type the command "code ." This will open VS Code (assuming you have it downloaded on your computer) and you can begin coding!</li>
          </ol>
    </ul>
   <h2>Editing and Viewing</h2>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>How to create a new (empty) project directory</strong></li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>In reference to the directions above, to create a new project directory, all you have to do is create a new directory without adding any files to it.</li>
          <li>From here, you can use the command "code ." and VS Code will open the corresponding file for editing.</li>
          <li>Alternatively, when opening the application by itself, there should be an obvious option to create a new directory for editing.</li>
        </ol>
      <li><strong>How to create a new (empty) HTML file named index.html within the new directory and edit it in VS Code</strong></li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>One way to create a new HTML file within the new directory is to simply hover over the file name in the lefthand window (also known as the sidebar) and select the new file icon (identified by hovering over each icon, as there are a few displayed and have different purposes).</li>
          <li>Name the new file "index.html" It's important to name the file this because it's easily recognizable homepage name; it makes it easier for the computer to locate the homepage. Other page names within the file aren't necessarily as important, however, every html page name should end in ".html" so that the computer is able to identify that it is in an html format.</li>
          <li>Once you've created the new page, it should display in the main section of the VS Code application (you can navigate the other pages using the tabs at the top of the VS Code screen).</li>
        </ol>
      <li><strong>How to write HTML in index.html</strong></li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>To begin coding your new HTML page, start typing "html" and select the "html:5" option. This will give you the basic framework of a HTML page to get started.</li>
          <li>Your HTML reflects the content of your webpage and is written between the body tages of the document.</li>
        </ol>
      <li><strong>How to open index.html in your browser and view it locally</strong></li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>One way to open your index.html page in your browser is to find it within the directory you've created it in (whether that be visually identifying it on your Desktop or using terminal) and prompting the computer to launch the page (again, depending on the tactic you use).</li>
        </ol>
      <li><strong>How to add an image to the project directory and display it on the webpage using the img tag</strong></li>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>To add an image to the project directory, move the image file into the directory. I typically drag and drop photos into the sidebar, which are then immediately identified as being either .png files, .jpeg files, etc.</li>
          <li>After including the image file into the project directory, type the following code as it relates to your image file between the body tags: "&lt;img src="yourimagefilename.png" alt="imagefilenickname" class="imagefilenickname&gt;</li>
        </ol>
   </ul>

I know that somewhere I missed a step in linking these correctly (I think it might have something to do with the fact that they're comments instead of written pieces on the html page), so I'd love some feedback on how to do this correctly. Also, I cannot for the life of me figure out a better way to write comments!
Also would love feedback for short cuts on the "One way" statements, because they reflect that there is probably a better way of doing this, but this is how I do it.
