  <h1>Development Environment</h1>
   <h2>Command Line</h2>
   <!--Learned how to comment here [url-comment-tag], how to make a bulleted list here [url-ul-tag], and how to cite these sources this way by referring to the README.md file-->
   <p><i>When using the command line, remember that every character counts! Yes, even the spaces!</i></p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>How to open the terminal outside of VS Code (using a Mac)</strong></li>
      <!--Learned how to make ordered lists here [url-ordered-lists]-->
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Hold the command key and spacebar to open "Spotlight Search"</li>
            <li>Begin typing "terminal" into the spotlight search––it should appear as you start typing.</li>
            <li>Select the terminal application, this should open after pressing the enter key or by clicking on the application itself.</li>
          </ol>
      <li><strong>How to use "cd" to navigate between directories</strong></li>
          <p><i>Before starting, it's helpful to know that "cd" stands for "computer directory," so when we use this command, we are essentially directing the computer to the directory we intend to make changes to or otherwise need information on. "Directories" refer to what we (assumingly non-technical people) call "folders."</i></p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Begin by typing the command "cd" by itself. This is the initial starting point for the computer to begin looking for subsequent directories. Imagine one big diagram that displays hirearchies, where there is one starting point (the "cd" command, or main computer directory) that breaks into different parts to form one large procedure of steps, or in this analogy, levels.</li>
            <li>You'll most likely want to navigate files within the Desktop (the area you see, decorated with files and folders and lives behind the browsers or applications you open), so your next command is "cd Desktop" to narrow in on the directories within the Desktop.</li>
            <li>To work with a particular directory on the Desktop, type "cd Desktop insertyourfilenamehere"</li>
            <li>To exit the directory you're currently working in (to back-up, if you will), you have to start over by beginning with the initial "cd" command.</li>
            <li>Happy navigating!</li>
          </ol>
     <li><strong>How to use "ls" to list the contents of a directory</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>After navigating to a particular directory (be it the initial directory ("cd"), Desktop––whichever directory you chose), type "ls" to reveal the directory's contents.</li>
          </ol>
    <li><strong>How to use "mkdir" to create an empty directory</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Begin by choosing the directory in which you'd like to create your new directory in, and orient the computer there (using the "cd" commands explained earlier).</li>
            <li>Type the command "mkdir insertnameofyournewdirectoryhere"</li>
            <li>You should now be able to view your new directory within the larger directory you made it in. For example, if all you wanted to do was create a new directory on the Desktop, that the computer was oriented in the "cd Desktop" location.</li>
          </ol>
    <li><strong>How to use "touch" to create an empty file</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Similar to how we can create new directories within directories, we can create new files too! Simply type the command "touch insertnameofyournewfilehere" and your new file will appear under the directory you created it in.</li>
          </ol>
    <li><strong>How to use "code" to open VS Code</strong></li>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Navigate to the appropriate directory (the one that has files you'd like to code) using the commands discussed above.</li>
            <li>Once in the appropriate directory, type the command "code ." This will open VS Code (assuming you have it downloaded on your computer) and you can begin coding!</li>
          </ol>
    </ul>

I know that somewhere I missed a step in linking these correctly (I think it might have something to do with the fact that they're comments instead of written pieces on the html page), so I'd love some feedback on how to do this correctly. Also, I cannot for the life of me figure out a better way to write comments!
